## Code Explanation

The code defines a C++ solution for [LeetCode Problem 33](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/), which encapsulates two main functions: `pivotElement` and `search`.

### `pivotElement` Function

In the problem statement, we are given a sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown pivot index. To efficiently search for a target integer in this rotated array, we need to locate the pivot index. The `pivotElement` function is a helper function responsible for finding the index of the pivot element in the rotated array. 

The pivot index represents the point where the array transitions from being in ascending order to a rotated position. Knowing the pivot index is crucial for the following reasons:
1. **Determine Search Space**
2. **Optimize Time Complexity**
3. **Ensure Accurate Search**

### `search` Function

The `search` function serves as the main algorithm to locate the target integer within the rotated array. Its operation involves the following steps:

1. It first calls the `pivotElement` function to determine the pivot index.
2. Based on the value of the `target` compared to the values at the pivot and the first element, the function decides whether to search the left or right subarray.
3. Subsequently, it performs a binary search within the appropriate subarray to find the `target`.
4. If the `target` is found, the function returns the index where it's located; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that the target integer is not present in the array.

This code effectively resolves the problem of searching for a target integer in a rotated sorted array with a time complexity of O(log n), where "n" denotes the number of elements in the array.
