# Code Explanation

The provided C++ code defines a solution for finding the longest palindromic substring in a given string. The code utilizes a dynamic programming strategy to improve efficiency compared to a simple brute-force approach with a time complexity of O(n^3).

## Approach
- Dynamic Programming: The code employs a dynamic programming strategy to efficiently find the longest palindromic substring.
- Odd and Even Length Strategy: The check_palindrome function is designed to check palindromes for both odd and even lengths. It iterates through each character as a potential center of the palindrome and expands outward.
- Comparison: The main function longestPalindrome compares the lengths of palindromes obtained using odd and even lengths and returns the longer one.

## Odd and Even Length Strategy

The `check_palindrome` function handles both odd and even lengths of palindromes. It iterates through each character as a potential center, expanding outward to find the longest palindromic substring.
- **Function Explanation:** The function takes `s`, a boolean `even` flag, and indices `index` representing the longest palindrome found.
- **Iterative Approach:** For odd-length palindromes, it considers a single character as the center; for even lengths, it considers two adjacent characters.
- **Expanding Outward:** The function expands outward from the potential center, comparing characters on both sides until a mismatch is found or the string boundaries are reached.
- **Updating Longest Palindrome:** It maintains the indices of the longest palindromic substring during expansion, updating if a longer palindrome is discovered.
- **Returning Substring:** After considering all potential centers, the function returns the longest palindromic substring found.

This strategy, utilized in the `longestPalindrome` main function, efficiently identifies the longest palindromic substring for different scenarios.


## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string s. The dynamic programming approach significantly reduces the time complexity compared to a brute-force approach.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as the code uses a constant amount of additional space.

## Advantages over Brute-Force (O(n^3))
The dynamic programming strategy used in this code provides a significant improvement over a simple brute-force approach, especially in terms of time complexity:

- Reduced Time Complexity: The dynamic programming approach reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2), making it more efficient for larger input strings.
- Efficient Palindrome Checking: The use of dynamic programming allows the algorithm to efficiently check palindromes for different lengths, avoiding redundant computations.
- Better Performance: The optimized approach significantly enhances the performance of the algorithm, making it suitable for practical applications.

In summary, the code offers an efficient solution for finding the longest palindromic substring through dynamic programming, demonstrating a considerable improvement over a brute-force approach.
