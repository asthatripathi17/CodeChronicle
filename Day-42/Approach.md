# Code Explanation

The following C++ code defines a solution for [LeetCode Problem 8](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/), which involves converting a string to an integer. The solution uses a state-based approach to handle different cases and constraints.

## Approach
In the context of the provided C++ code for converting a string to an integer, a state-based approach involves tracking and managing different states or conditions as the program iterates through the characters of the input string.


- State-Based Parsing: The code uses a state-based approach to parse the input string and handle different cases:
  - It maintains states for sign, space, and digit characters.
    - sign represents the sign of the integer (positive or negative).
    - once ensures that certain actions are performed only once.
    - space helps manage the presence of spaces in the string.
  - It uses a checkCase function to handle overflow and underflow conditions.

_A state-based approach involves maintaining and updating the state of the algorithm as it processes input, allowing it to adapt its behavior according to different conditions and requirements. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex scenarios or when the behavior of the algorithm needs to vary based on certain conditions._
- Iterative Parsing: The code iterates through each character in the input string and adjusts the state accordingly.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string s. The code processes each character once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as the code uses a constant amount of additional space.

In simpler terms, the code converts a string to an integer while considering various cases such as leading spaces, signs, and integer overflow/underflow.

## Additional Approach using STL
Another way to convert a string to an integer is by utilizing the atoi function from the C++ Standard Library:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // Included for atoi function

class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(std::string s) {
        return atoi(s.c_str());
    }
};
```

- atoi Function: The atoi function is a part of the C Standard Library, and it stands for "ASCII to Integer." It converts a string containing an integer representation in ASCII to an actual integer.
- c_str Function: The c_str function is used to obtain a pointer to an array that contains a null-terminated sequence of characters representing the current value of the string. This pointer is then passed to atoi for conversion.

When calling functions like atoi (which is a C function), you can use c_str() to obtain a pointer to the character array of the C++ string.

### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string s. The code processes each character once.
- Space Complexity: O(1) for the state-based approach, O(N) for the atoi approach (due to the temporary null-terminated string).
