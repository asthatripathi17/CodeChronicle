# Code Explanation

The following C++ code defines a solution for [LeetCode Problem 735](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/), which involves simulating the collision of asteroids moving in different directions. The solution utilizes a stack to model the collision scenarios.
The code defines a `Solution` class with an `asteroidCollision` function that simulates the collision of asteroids moving in different directions.

## Approach

- **Collision Simulation:** The code uses a stack (`st`) to simulate asteroid collisions.
- **Iterative Collision Checking:** It iterates through each asteroid and checks for collision scenarios:
  - If the stack is empty, the asteroid is simply pushed onto the stack.
  - If opposite signs are detected (first one is moving right, the other is moving left), a collision occurs.
    - If the asteroids have equal magnitudes, they annihilate each other.
    - If the top asteroid has a smaller magnitude, it is destroyed, and the index is adjusted.
    - If the current asteroid has a smaller magnitude, it gets destroyed.
  - If no collision occurs, the asteroid is pushed onto the stack.
- **Building the Result:**
  - The final result is built by extracting elements from the stack.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of asteroids. The code processes each asteroid once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), as the stack stores asteroids proportional to the input size.

In simpler terms, the code models asteroid collisions using a stack, handling scenarios where asteroids with opposite signs collide, and producing the final result without collisions.
