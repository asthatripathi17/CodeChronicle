# Code Explanation

The provided C++ code defines a solution for converting an integer to its Roman numeral representation. The algorithm employs a map to store the relationship between integers and their corresponding Roman numeral symbols, ensuring a proper conversion from the largest to the smallest values.

## Map Based Approach

- Map for Roman Numerals: The algorithm uses a map to establish the relationship between integers and their corresponding Roman numeral symbols. This ensures a proper conversion from the largest to the smallest values.
- Iterative Conversion: The algorithm iteratively subtracts the largest possible values from the input integer and appends the corresponding Roman numeral symbols to the result string.
- Special Cases Handling: Special cases like 4, 9, 40, 90, etc., are defined in the map to handle specific conversions.
- Reverse Iteration: The map is iterated in reverse order to start from the largest possible values and move towards smaller ones. (using iterators like store.rbegin() and store.rend())

### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - The space used is constant as it does not depend on the input size.

The map has a fixed number of entries representing specific integer values and their corresponding Roman numerals. Therefore, even though we use a data structure (map) to store this information, the actual space used is constant. In Big O notation, when analyzing algorithms, constants are often ignored, and only the dominant terms are considered. In this case, the space complexity is usually expressed as O(1) because the number of entries in the map does not grow with the input size. 

The algorithm efficiently converts an integer to its Roman numeral representation using a map and ensures proper handling of special cases.

## Vector Based Approach
- Vectors for Roman Numerals: An alternative approach uses two vectors to store the Roman numeral symbols and their corresponding integer values. The vectors, namely values and symbols, ensure a direct mapping between integers and Roman numerals.
- Iterating through Vectors: Instead of a map, the algorithm iterates through the values and symbols vectors simultaneously. This approach eliminates the need for a map and simplifies the code.
- Reverse Iteration: The vectors are iterated in reverse order, starting from the largest possible values and moving towards smaller ones. This ensures that the algorithm subtracts the largest possible value iteratively during the conversion process.

```cpp
  vector<int> values = {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1};
  vector<string> symbols = {"M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"};
```
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - The space used is constant as it does not depend on the input size.

The alternative approach provides a concise and efficient way to convert an integer to its Roman numeral representation using two vectors for direct mappings.
